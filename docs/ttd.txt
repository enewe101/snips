- make controler state changes happen as close to the event trigger as possible
	to prevent buried state changes from introducing surprises.

- handle the case where a snip is still pending it's save request and the
	user deletes it -- it's probably ok to silently do nothing.  You can't 
	delete it (there's no id yet, and the delete would race with the insert
	anyway) and the silence is signal because the user expects the snip to
	dissappear but it doesn't.
